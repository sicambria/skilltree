## Skill levels

#### Self-assessing levels

To achieve a level a person must have demonstrated the 5Cs, standing for Conscious, Comfortable, Continuous, Consistent and Competency, defined as follows:

```sh
Conscious: having devoted intentional effort to this endeavour,
Comfortable: without being overly stretched,
Continuous: for a reasonable period of time,
Consistent: reliably and evenly,
Competency: meeting the criteria.
```

As a natural consequence, a person does not achieve a milestone the first time they demonstrate relevant behaviours or tasks.
Overall, if it is not Clear that a person is at a given milestone, they are at the previous milestone.
