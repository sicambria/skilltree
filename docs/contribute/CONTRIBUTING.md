# Contributing to SkillTree

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to SkillTree and its packages, which are hosted on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [SkillTree Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nokia/skilltree/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How Can I Contribute?

For coding you need an IDE of your choice, we recommend [Atom] or [Visual Studio Code].

For Atom, installing some plugins are helpful:

```sh
apm install emmet todo minimap pigments minimap-pigments linter file-icons git-diff atom-beautify ask-stack highlight-selected
```

On the server, give it a try:

```sh
cd skilltree
node app.js
```

Alternatively, to keep up with changes automatically, install & use PM2 (recommended):
```sh
cd skilltree
pm2 create skilltree
```
To run:
```sh
pm2 start skilltree --watch
```
To query the status:
```sh
pm2 list
```

### Testing

Youtube tutorial for testing using [Mocha and Chai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhlpFD5EL_Q).

Install mocha and chai (already installed in this project):
```sh
npm install mocha
npm install chai --save-dev
```

To run tests:
```sh
cd assets
mocha
```

Edit tests in assets/test folder. Create new JavaScript file or use the existing unit-test.js and add functions.


### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for SkillTree. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/nokia/skilltree/issues)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#SkillTree-and-packages) your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started SkillTree, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started SkillTree otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an SkillTree command, and if so which one?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version) or was this always a problem?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), **does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some?** Does the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), with files of a specific type (e.g. only JavaScript or Python files), with large files or files with very long lines, or with files in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version are you using?** You can get the exact version by looking at the version on the main page.
* **What's the name and version of the browser you're using**? (note that Internet Explorer is not supported)




### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through LGTM: [![Total alerts](https://img.shields.io/lgtm/alerts/g/nokia/skilltree.svg?logo=lgtm&logoWidth=18)](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/nokia/skilltree/alerts/)

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain quality (refactoring, writing test cases, etc.)
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Get new features onboard


Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
